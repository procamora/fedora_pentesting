# fedora_pentesting

fedora_pentesting is a script to install in a Fedora OS the main tools used in pentesting.

 
This script can be run on either a native machine or a container.

## Installation

 
The script can be executed by putting sudo to the command or not. If you run it without sudo, the script will ask for the user's password when needed to execute administration commands to install packages or modify permissions.

It is important to tell the sudo command which user is executing it, so that it works correctly with the environment variables of this user.


```bash
./fedora_pentesting.sh > install.log

# OR

sudo -u $USER ./fedora_pentesting.sh > install.log
```



A series of directories have been defined where programs and scripts will be stored, these directories are



- */opt/pentesting*: In this directory is where you install all the programs that require a download of the source code for later compilation.
- */usr/share/wordlists*: In this directory you can download the dictionaries
- */usr/share/pentesting*: In this directory are downloaded the tools and scripts that do not require installation.
- */usr/local/bin*: In this directory you download or link the binaries of the programs so that they can be executed directly















## Basic Usage


The script requires an argument with the action to be performed. The available actions are the following options:

- **install**: Installing the basic pentesting packages.
- **extra**: Installing the extra pentesting packages. Currently this mode only installs ghydra.
- **uninstall**: Uninstalling the basic pentesting packages.
- **unextra**: Uninstalling the extra pentesting packages.
- **gui**: Installing the pentesting packages with graphic environment, such as ZAP Proxy or Burp Suite.
- **upgrade**: Upgrade the extra pentesting packages (same as install).





### Maquina nativa


### Contenedor docker/podman


You can use a container with all the tools already installed using docker or podman. The image is located in: [https://hub.docker.com/r/procamora/pentesting][dockerhub].


[dockerhub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/procamora/pentesting

```bash
podman run -ti --rm --hostname=pentest -p 2222:22 --name pentest procamora/pentesting
```


When the image is started, a shell directly starts up, but it also has SSH enabled with a certificate so that it can be connected or files can be transferred.


```bash
ssh -i ssh/id_rsa root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
```



> Note the user is root and the RSA keys he uses are in the **ssh** directory of the repository.



In the case of using a container, applications that require a graphical environment such as Burp Suite or ZAP Proxy do not work yet.
